# Blackbird IP and Vulnerability Scanner

**Author**: MD Faysal Mahmud

## Description

Blackbird IP and Vulnerability Scanner is a Python-based tool designed for network reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment. It scans IP addresses or CIDR ranges to gather detailed information, including WHOIS data, geolocation, open ports, services, vulnerabilities, and potential attack vectors. The tool leverages libraries like `nmap`, `ipwhois`, and `geocoder` to provide comprehensive network insights and generates HTML reports for easy analysis. It is designed to run on Kali Linux, Ubuntu, and macOS.

**Key Features**:
- Scans single IPs or CIDR ranges for network and device information.
- Retrieves WHOIS data, geolocation, open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
- Suggests potential attack vectors based on identified vulnerabilities.
- Generates HTML reports with responsive design for scan results.
- Utilizes multithreading for efficient scanning.
- Caches WHOIS and geolocation data to optimize performance.

   ```

## How to Use

1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python3 blackbird.py
   ```
2. **Main Menu Options**:
   - **Option 1**: Scan a single IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
   - **Option 2**: Scan a CIDR range (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).
   - **Option 3**: Generate an HTML report for the last scan.
   - **Option 4**: Exit the program.

3. **Output**:
   - Scan results are displayed in the console with colored output.
   - HTML reports are saved in the `Ipreport` folder with a timestamped filename.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Nmap not found**:
   - Ensure Nmap is installed (`nmap --version`).
   - Verify the Nmap path in the script (`/usr/bin/nmap` for Kali Linux).
   - On macOS, ensure Nmap is in your PATH after installing via Homebrew.

2. **Permission errors**:
   - Run the script with `sudo` if scanning privileged ports or using certain Nmap features:
     ```bash
     sudo python3 blackbird.py
     ```

3. **Module not found**:
   - Ensure all Python dependencies are installed using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` (create a `requirements.txt` with `ipwhois`, `geocoder`, `python-nmap`, `colorama`).
   - Example `requirements.txt`:
     ```text
     ipwhois
     geocoder
     python-nmap
     colorama
     ```

4. **Timeout or network errors**:
   - Check your internet connection for WHOIS and geolocation queries.
   - Increase the timeout in the script (e.g., `timeout=30` in `get_whois_info` or `get_open_ports`).
   - Reduce the number of concurrent scans by adjusting `max_workers` in `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

5. **No vulnerabilities found**:
   - Ensure Nmapâ€™s vulnerability scripts are installed (`/usr/share/nmap/scripts/` on Kali Linux).
   - Update Nmap to the latest version:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install nmap -y
     ```

6. **Report not generating**:
   - Check if the `Ipreport` folder has write permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod -R 755 Ipreport
     ```

### Debugging
- Run the script with verbose output by adding print statements or using a debugger like `pdb`.
- Check Nmap scan logs for errors:
  ```bash
  nmap -d 192.168.1.1
  ```
